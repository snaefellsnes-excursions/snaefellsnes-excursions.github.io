Absolutely! We prioritize ensuring that all participants of our Grundarfjordur shore excursions return to the harbor in time for their cruise ship departure.

Whether you're on our [Scenic Snæfellsnes Tour](https://rutuferdir.is/tours/snaefellsnes-tour.html) or the [Shark Museum and Stykkishólmur Tour](https://rutuferdir.is/tours/west-tour.html), we manage the schedule meticulously, so you can relax and enjoy your adventure without any worries.
