Meals are not included in our tours unless specified otherwise.

We make scheduled stops where you can purchase meals and refreshments; however, options may be limited and can become crowded during busy periods. For this reason, you may wish to bring your own packed lunch.

Please note that eating on board our coaches is not allowed.
