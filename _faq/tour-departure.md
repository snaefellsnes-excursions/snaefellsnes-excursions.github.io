order: 40

Our cruise excursions start from the harbour in Grundarfjörður. 

The meeting point for your tour is located on the harbour, directly to the right of where you disembark from the ship or tender.

You should look for a black bus, which will serve as our temporary office on the harbour.

Our tours end at Grundarfjörður harbour, to make it easier for you to return promptly to your ship.
