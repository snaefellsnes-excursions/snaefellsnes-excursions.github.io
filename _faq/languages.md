Our scheduled bus tours for cruise ship passengers are usually offered in English. 

On certain days, we offer tours of the Snæfellsnes Peninsula in Italian and German. 

[Contact us](https://rutuferdir.is/#contact) to know when these are available. 

Please note that on our [Snæfellsnes Short Tour]({% link _tours/snaefellsnes-short.md %}) we offer an onboard aud-guide.
