title: Where do your cruise excursions from Reykjavik start and end?
order: 45
---
Our Reykjavik cruise excursions start from the harbour in Reykjavik. 

The meeting point for your tour is at the parking lot by Skarfabakki 312 Terminal.

Our tours then end in the same place where they started, to make it easier for you to return promptly to your ship.
