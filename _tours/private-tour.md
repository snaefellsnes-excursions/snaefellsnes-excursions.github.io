A **private tour** is ideal if you want to explore Iceland at your own speed and away from the large crowds.
We organize and provide **private tours of the Snaefellsnes Peninsula**, one of Iceland's most intriguing places within a few hours' drive from Reykjavik.

Visiting Snæfellsnes provides you a glimpse of Iceland's **diverse landscape**, including extensive lava fields, breathtaking waterfalls, dormant volcano craters, black beaches, sea cliffs, and even a glacier.
But here you can also learn about the region's rich **folklore**, **history**, and the sites immortalized in the **Icelandic Sagas**.

On a private tour, you can discover the wonders of the Snæfellsnes Peninsula with the help of our knowledgeable local driverguides. 
We hear your preferences and can arrange a private tour of Snæfellsnes that meets your requirements and interests, but here are some **sites we recommend** visiting while you are here.

With its black pebble beach and breathtaking lava formations, **Djúpalónssandur** is one of Snæfellsnes' most famous attractions.
There is no better way to feel at one with Iceland's dramatic and strong nature than a stroll down the black beach, surrounded by stunning rock formations, some of which are thought to be inhabited by elves.

**Lóndrangar** consists of two enormous rock stacks that rise from the ocean, uniquely formed from an ancient volcanic crater. Icelanders prefer to think of them as a couple of **Trolls** who were petrified while fishing. 
It is a short walk from the parking area to the viewpoint, where you can take in the breathtaking scenery of coastal cliffs and lava formations that are slowly being worn away by the ocean waves and winds.

One of our favorite sites on the Snæfellsnes Peninsula is **Arnarstapi**. As there is so much to see here, a private tour of Snæfellsnes is an excellent way to see it all.
This incredibly charming fishing town is situated at the base of **Snæfellsjökull** and is guarded by the massive statue of **Bárður Snæfellsás**, a fabled half-human, half-troll figure from the early days of Iceland's settlement. 

A trail extends down the coastline from the **Arnarstapi harbour**, a picturesque natural harbor that made Arnarstapi a prosperous trading center in the past, and offers stunning panoramas of the sea cliffs, basalt rock formations, and ocean.
The path then continues through a lava field and ends in **Hellnar**, where you may take in the sights of a beautiful beach, fascinating rock formations, cliffs, and a cave whose color changes with the light of the sun and the motion of the waves.
You may walk from one town to the next while joining a private tour of Snæfellsnes, and we'll pick you up at the trailhead to resume the journey.

**Snæfellsjökull**, one of Iceland's most well-known glaciers, is where the protagonist of Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth finds the entrance to the center of the planet. Snæfellsnes' National Park is named after the glacier-capped volcano that sits at the very extremity of the peninsula. If the weather cooperates, you may be treated to breathtaking views of the glacier from several points along the road that circles Snæfellsnes. For a more thrilling adventure, on a private tour of Snæfellsnes we can drive our jeep across a rugged mountain pass to get closer to the glacier. 

Not to be forgotten is the magnificent **Kirkjufell**. Because of its distinctive shape—which has been compared to a cathedral by some—and its appearance in the hit HBO series Game of Thrones, this mountain has become one of Iceland's most recognizable landmarks and is believed to be Iceland's most photographed mountain. **Kirkjufellsfoss**, a stunning waterfall just opposite the road from the mountain, is the ideal vantage point for taking breathtaking pictures of the peak.
