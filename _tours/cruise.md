The tours we have available are **[group tours]({% link _tours/bus-tour.md %})** or **[personalized private tours]({% link _tours/private-tour.md %})** around Snæfellsnes. All our tours are designed to fit within your cruise's stop-over time. 

We also provide bus rental services and transportation from one town to another on Snæfellsnes if you are joining an activity or excursion somewhere other than your port of call.
