Come along on a bus trip around Snæfellsnes to see some of the region's top sights and experience Iceland's rich and diverse landscapes. 

We begin our trip around the Snæfellsnes at the tranquil town of **Grundarfjörður**, located on the northern shore of the Snæfellsnes Peninsula. Grundarfjörður is a great starting point to explore the area. 

The first stop on the journey is **Saxhóll**, a dormant volcanic crater created thousands of years ago. Although the colorful lava of the crater is maybe best seen from below, a simple 400-step stairway leads to the crater top, where visitors are rewarded with a breathtaking 360-degree panoramic of the crater and the surrounding moss-covered lava fields.

Driving along the scenic road circling Snæfellsnes, we keep going until we reach **Malariff**, where you may learn more about the region's history, geology and ecology at the **Snæfellsjökull National Park Visitors Center**, or take a refreshing stroll to a nearbyy black pebble beach with a lighthouse and enjoy a scenic view of **Lóndrangar** sea cliffs.

**Arnarstapi**, one of our favorite places on Snæfellsnes, is the next destination on our adventure. Located at the foot of the famed Snaefellsjökull glacier, this little but charming fishing town offers a beautiful footpath along the coastline to view sea cliffs and stunning rock formations.
We take a lunch break at Arnarstapi. There are a few nearby dining options, including Samkomuhúsið, a small café with facilities and a gift shop selling traditional Icelandic sweaters and other handcrafted items.

We then travel north via a mountain pass with stunning views of the region's highlands and valleys to reach **Kirkjufell**, one of Iceland's most photographed peaks. The mountain's distinctive cone shape and nearby waterfalls have made it famouns. This landmark, sometimes referred to as "arrow-head mountain" due to its shape, appeared in the popular HBO series Game of Thrones. 
From the parking lot, you can easily walk to **Kirkjufellsfoss**, where you may take the iconic shot of the waterfall with the mountain in the background.

As Grundarfjörður is just around 2.5 km (or 1.5 mi) away, you can choose to walk back to the village after visiting Kirkjufell.
If you are not up to walking, you can jus hop back on the bus with us and we will drive back to Grundarfjörður, where you can continue your adventure in town or around Iceland.
