Embark on a breathtaking journey from the picturesque **Snæfellsnes Peninsula**, a prime location for encountering Iceland's marine giants such as **orcas** and **sperm whales**. 

Our **whale watching tours**, available from February to September, are conducted in partnership with a local expert company and offer a unique opportunity to witness these magnificent creatures in their natural habitat. Keep an eye out for humpback whales, pilot whales, Minke whales, and dolphins during our intimate 2 to 3.5-hour excursions.

Guided by our knowledgeable crew, fluent in English, you will gain fascinating insights into the lives of these majestic animals while ensuring your adventure is both comfortable and safe. We recommend dressing warmly and being prepared for variable weather conditions, which can occasionally influence tour schedules.

Booking this whale watching experience not only promises a memorable expedition but also supports sustainable and respectful wildlife watching practices. In the rare event that no whales or dolphins are sighted, we offer a reschedule ticket for another day, ensuring every effort is made to make your visit rewarding.
