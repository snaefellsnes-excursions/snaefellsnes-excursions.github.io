Join us on a fascinating journey through the mesmerizing wonders of Snæfellsnes, a region of Iceland that promises to leave a lasting impression. Prepare for an extraordinary tour where nature’s breathtaking landscapes unfold at every twist and turn. 

Our adventure begins in the small village of **Grundarfjörður**,  where your vessel is anchored, and where your tour bus awaits, ready to transport you to some of  the top sites of Snæfellsnes Peninsula.

Our first destination is **Malarrif**, a gateway to the **Snæfellsjökull National Park**. Delve into the region's rich history, geology, and fauna at the **Visitors Center** or opt for a leisurely stroll to a nearby black pebble beach where crashing waves and a majestic lighthouse create a mesmerizing backdrop. From here you can also enjoy a scenic view of **Lóndrangar** lava stacks.

Next, venture to **Arnarstapi**, a picturesque village nestled beneath the legendary **Snæfellsjökull**, one of Iceland’s most famous glaciers. Embark on a scenic walking trail along the shore, where awe-inspiring sea cliffs and extraordinary rock formations showcase nature's artistry. 
We take a longer break in Arnarstapi. There are a few nearby dining options, including Samkomuhúsið, a small café with facilities and a gift shop selling traditional Icelandic sweaters and other handcrafted items.

Continuing along the winding road of the Snæfellsnes Peninsula, discover the **Maritime Museum** in **Hellissandur**. Immerse yourself in the local fishing traditions and explore a turf house, gaining insights into Icelanders' lives not so long ago.

The grand finale awaits at **Kirkjufell**, an iconic peak that has captured the attention of photographers worldwide. Marvel at its cone-shaped silhouette elegantly rising above the earth, with cascading waterfalls adding an ethereal touch. Game of Thrones enthusiasts may recognize this mystical location as the "arrow-head mountain". Capture the perfect shot of **Kirkjufellsfoss**, the waterfall, gracefully dancing in harmony with the mountain's grandeur.

After enjoying your time in the Kirkjufell area, you have the option of walking back to the village of Grundarfjörður, a mere 2.5 km/1.5 mi away. 
Alternatively, we offer a comfortable drive back to the harbor, ensuring you return in ample time to embark on your ship, with memories that will forever linger in your heart.
